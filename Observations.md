### a

- None

### b

- Thumb base will not move on robot, thumb could be made longer.

### c

- Have to turn wrist and bend hand for this.

### d

- Thumb pressing over middle finger. May just have to rest close in front of.

### e

- Thumb placement may not allow it to be exactly under the fingers. Just something to be conscious of.
