# what we were doing at the end of the year
- realized that the servos and the arduino can't both be on the inside because they'll tear each other apart
- servo mounting holes are too close together (also true on the servo modelâ€½)
- sometimes the wires come out of the servo connectors
- do the servos even have enough articulation to move the elastic the full distance?
- use wires to fish elastic through fingers
- finger monuts are too thin
- current fingers should probably be reprinted (hopefully on the prusas)
- use proper mounting hardware this time instead of superglue
