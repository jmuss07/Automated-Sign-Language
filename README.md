## Goals and Planning

**Mission Statement**: To create a robotic, anthropomorphic hand that can display the ASL alphabet and basic one-handed gestures.

**Test of Success**: Through the hand, using the ASL alphabet, a word can be transmitted, received, and interpreted in under two minutes.

**Proof of Concept**: [ASLAN robot](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/this-3d-printed-robotic-arm-is-built-for-sign-language/) made by Uni. of Antwerp students.
