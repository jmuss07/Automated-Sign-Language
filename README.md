## Goals and Planning

**Mission Statement**: To create a robotic, anthropomorphic hand that can display the ASL alphabet and basic one-handed gestures.

**Test of Success**: Through the hand, using the ASL alphabet, a word can be transmitted, received, and interpreted in under two minutes.

**Proof of Concept**: [ASLAN robot](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/18/this-3d-printed-robotic-arm-is-built-for-sign-language/) made by Uni. of Antwerp students.

### What we don't know

- How to make a moveable finger joint.
- Typed input into letters, into hand sign. What's the process? (Library of servo movements? for each letter?).
- Turn speech into text that can be then inputted.
- Some signs and gestures require either unnatural movement, or a more complex process.
  - The signs for "z" and "j" require excessive movement of the arm.
  - Thumbs-up and thumbs-down require arm rotation.
  - etc.
